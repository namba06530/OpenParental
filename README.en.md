OpenParental is an open source parental control solution for Ubuntu. It provides easy deployment and robust features for families, schools, and public spaces: screen time management, web filtering, Internet quotas, and more.

## üöÄ Why OpenParental?
- **Open Source**: 100% free, transparent, and customizable.
- **Simple**: Automated installation scripts, no proprietary lock-in.
- **Secure**: Strict account separation, multi-layer filtering, secure SSH setup.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions welcome to improve digital safety for all.

## üöÄ Standard Installation (family, school, public space...)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenParental.git
   cd OpenParental
   ```
2. **Customize the** `.env` **file** (a ready-to-use example is provided as `.env.example`)
3. **Run the full installation**
   ```bash
   sudo ./00-install.sh
   ```

That's it! The 00-install.sh script handles everything: account creation, network setup, filtering, quotas, antivirus, final security, and more.

> **Tip**: This method works for a single family computer or a fleet of devices in schools or public spaces.

## üöö Deploying on Child Devices

> **Note**: For most use cases, simply follow the standard installation procedure above on each device to be protected. The 00-install.sh script automatically configures Internet quota management, filtering, security, etc.

If you want to deploy **only the Internet quota management** on an existing device (advanced use):

1. Clone the repository and adapt the .env
2. Run only:
   ```bash
   sudo ./06-set-internet-quota.sh
   ```

## üìù Roadmap

- Parents remain responsible for supervision.
