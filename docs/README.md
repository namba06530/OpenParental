## üéØ Project Goals

- Provide robust and customizable parental control
- Simplify deployment and configuration
- Enable effective monitoring and management of screen and Internet time
- Protect children from inappropriate online content

## üõ† Solution Components

### 1. Account Management
- Creation of a hidden admin account
- Separation of privileges between admin and users
- Protection of access to system settings

### 2. Secure Remote Access
- SSH configuration for remote administration
- Securing access
- Remote monitoring

### 3. DNS Filtering
- Automatic configuration of Cloudflare Family DNS (1.1.1.3 and 1.0.0.3)
- Blocking of malicious and adult content
- Protection against DNS settings modification

### 4. Web Filtering with hBlock
- Advanced blocking of ads, trackers, and malicious content
- Automatic update of blocklists
- Additional protection via the system hosts file

### 5. Screen Time Control (Timekpr-nExT)
- Limiting computer usage time
- Defining allowed time slots
- Detailed usage tracking

### 6. Internet Connection Management (Quota)
- Limiting Internet connection time
- Customizable quota system
- Usage monitoring
- Dedicated script to deploy on each child machine

### 7. Logging System
- Comprehensive logging with multiple levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SECURITY)
- Automatic log rotation and cleanup
- Detailed tracking of system events and user actions
- Secure storage of logs with proper permissions

## üìã Prerequisites

- Ubuntu (recommended version: 22.04 LTS or higher)
- A user account with sudo rights for initial installation
- NetworkManager
- Internet connection to install components
- iptables for network filtering

## üöÄ Standard Installation (family, school, association...)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/namba06530/OpenParental.git
   cd OpenParental
   ```
2. **Customize the** `.env` **file** (a ready-to-use example is provided as `.env.example`)
3. **Run the full installation**
   ```bash
   sudo ./00-install.sh
   ```

That's it! The 00-install.sh script takes care of everything: account creation, network configuration, filtering, quotas, antivirus, final hardening, etc.

> **Tip**: This method works for both a family computer and a fleet of computers in a school or public place.

## üöö Deployment on Child Machines

> **Note**: For most use cases, simply follow the standard installation procedure above on each machine to be protected. The 00-install.sh script automatically configures Internet quota management, filtering, security, etc.

If you want to deploy **only the Internet quota management** on an existing machine (advanced use case):

1. Clone the repository and adapt the .env
2. Run only:
   ```bash
   sudo ./06-set-internet-quota.sh
   ```

## üìù Roadmap

- [x] Installation scripts (account creation, filtering, quotas, etc.)
- [x] Unified installation script (00-install.sh, single entry point)
- [x] Internet Quota feature (Internet quota management)
- [x] Logging system implementation
- [x] Automated testing framework
- [ ] Separation of Internet time and screen time (priority)
- [ ] Improved multi-user management for Internet quota and screen time
- [ ] Graphical administration interface
- [ ] Reporting and statistics system
- [ ] Backup and restore configurations
- [ ] Remote web administration interface
- [ ] Automatic component updates
- [ ] Notification system for parents
- [ ] Enhanced multi-user support
- [ ] Detailed configuration documentation
- [ ] First-time setup assistant

> üí° The separation of Internet time and screen time is now the project's top priority. Feel free to suggest new ideas or contribute to the roadmap!

## üîí Security & Privacy
- No data sent outside the machine by default.
- Logs and quotas remain local.
- Parents remain responsible for supervision.
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data.
- Regular security audits and updates.

## üìö Detailed Documentation

### Admin Account
- Creation of a hidden admin account
- Sudo rights configuration
- Login interface protection

### SSH Configuration
- Secure installation
- Key and access configuration
- Recommended security settings

### DNS Configuration
The `03-force-custom-dns.sh` script:
- Configures NetworkManager to ignore DHCP DNS
- Uses Cloudflare Family DNS for filtering
- Protects the configuration from changes

### Time Management
Timekpr-nExT allows:
- Setting daily limits
- Configuring allowed time slots
- Managing multiple user accounts

### Internet Quota
The `src/internet-quota.sh` script manages:
- Limiting connection time
- Usage tracking
- Custom quota rules
- Notifications and whitelist management
- Simple and efficient logging of usage data

### Logging System
The `src/lib/logging.sh` library provides:
- Multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SECURITY)
- Automatic log rotation
- Secure storage of logs
- Detailed event tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Filtering with hBlock
hBlock allows:
- Blocking ads and trackers
- Protection against malicious domains
- Regular update of blocklists
- Customization of whitelists/blacklists

## üîí Final Hardening: Automatic Removal of Scripts and .env File

At the very end of the installation, when running the `99-final-script.sh` script, a hardening phase is offered:

- **Automatic removal of all installation scripts** (`00-*.sh` to `99-*.sh`)
- **Removal of the `.env` file** (containing sensitive parameters)

This step strengthens security by removing anything that could allow reconfiguration or bypassing protection after installation.

> You can choose to accept or refuse this removal when running the script. If you refuse, remember to manually delete these files for optimal security.

## Tests

The project includes several test suites to ensure system quality and reliability:

### Logging Tests

The logging tests are organized into three distinct categories:

1. **Logging Infrastructure Tests** (`test-logging.sh`)
   - Verifies basic logging system functionality
   - Tests log file creation, rotation, and cleanup
   - Ensures logging infrastructure works correctly

2. **Error Handling Tests** (`test-error-handling-module.sh`)
   - Verifies error formatting and handling
   - Tests integration between logging system and error handling
   - Ensures error messages are properly formatted and recorded

3. **Log Usage Tests**
   - Verifies log usage in specific contexts
   - Tests log integration with other features
   - Ensures logs are properly used across different modules

All tests are executed in isolated Docker containers to ensure security and reproducibility.

## üîß Internet Quota Module

A modular internet quota system has been integrated into the project to allow precise control over users' Internet connection time. This system is designed to be:

- **Modular**: Architecture based on separate modules for logging, security, configuration, and core functionalities
- **Secure**: Data file protection, permission verification, and locking to prevent corruption
- **Automated**: Systemd services for automatic tracking and resetting of quotas
- **Easy to use**: Simple command-line interface with intuitive commands

### Main commands

- **Display current status**: `internet-quota status`
- **Increment quota**: `internet-quota increment [minutes]`
- **Reset quota**: `internet-quota reset`
- **Configure the system**: `internet-quota config [key=value]`

The quota system helps parents enforce Internet time limits while maintaining flexibility through configuration options like whitelists for educational websites.
